# Advanced Web Scraping Practice

A professional repository containing **all my web scraping practice projects**. This repository demonstrates modern scraping techniques, including concurrency, pagination, crawling, and real-world data extraction using Go.

---

## 🚀 Technologies & Tools Used

- **Go (Golang)**
  - [Colly](https://github.com/gocolly/colly) for fast and concurrent web scraping
  - Async scraping, request throttling, custom headers, and concurrency control


- **Data Storage**
  - CSV, JSON, SQLite, PostgreSQL (for practice purposes)

- **Other Concepts**
  - Pagination handling
  - Multi-page crawling
  - Dynamic user-agent rotation
  - Proxy integration
  - Concurrent request handling
  - Rate limiting & delay strategies


---

## 💡 Features Demonstrated

- **Concurrent scraping**: Multiple requests handled asynchronously
- **Pagination crawling**: Automatically scrape multi-page content
- **Detail page extraction**: Extract nested data from product pages
- **Dynamic headers**: Rotate user-agents to avoid blocks
- **Error handling**: Retry failed requests and log errors
- **Rate limiting**: Delay between requests to mimic human behavior
